# 🚀 QUICK START - Unified-Agentic-OS Research

**Start here if you're in a hurry**

## ⚡ 5-Minute Quick Answer

### Q: Bisa clone OpenClaw dan develop versi sendiri untuk unified-agentic-os?

**A: YES ✅ - Tapi dengan aturan**

```
BOLEH clone:
✅ PATTERNS (5 architecture patterns)
✅ CONFIGURATION (TypeScript, linting, testing setup)
✅ STRUCTURE (folder organization approach)

JANGAN clone:
❌ CODE (channel implementations, specific features)
❌ STORAGE (file-based system)
❌ FINANCE LOGIC (tidak ada di OpenClaw)
```

## ✅ 5 Patterns to Clone from OpenClaw

1. **Plugin Registry** - Load channels dynamically
2. **Dependency Injection** - Central deps container
3. **Event-Driven** - Event emitters for loosely coupled code
4. **Error Handling** - Structured error management
5. **Retry Logic** - Exponential backoff for reliability

All documented in **05-Clone-OpenClaw-Guide.md**

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

```
❌ Clone entire OpenClaw code
❌ Use file-based storage for payments
❌ Expect OpenClaw to handle finance
❌ Start coding before reading docs
❌ Build UI first
❌ Hardcode configuration
```
